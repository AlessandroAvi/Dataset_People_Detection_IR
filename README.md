# Dataset_People_Detection_IR

This repo contains the dataset generated for the paper [Infrared Dataset Generation for People Detection Through Superimposition of Different Camera Sensors](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021W/DSC/html/Avi_Infrared_Dataset_Generation_for_People_Detection_Through_Superimposition_of_Different_ICCVW_2021_paper.html). 

The two files in this repo are:

- `Dataset_100_sample.zip`	which contains only 100 couples of IR and B&W images as a sample
- `Dataset.zip`    which contains all the 3655 couples of IR and B&W images

Below two previews of the images in the dataset are shown.
